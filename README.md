Kaggle problem-Predicting where a system with windows OS contains malware based on various features
As part of IS-Problem Solving Using Machine Learning, the objective of this course 
project is to solve a classification problem using basic ML techniques(without NN)
```
```
Approach1:
```
* Drop Features with little variation
* Use PCA on remaining features
* Apply models such as SVM,RF,Logistic Regression

```
Approach2
K-Fold Cross Validation
```
* Light GBM to train the model
* Light GBM provides better AUC. 
* Also, we need not treat missing data. It assigns missing feture records to whiever split reduces entropy more.
